# Demistifying-AI-Human-Centered-Data-Products
Human centered data products are digital products that use Artificial Intelligence [AI] technology to visually support decision-making and help humans control complex systems. 
The data product landscape is dominated by data producers such as Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Tableau, Netflix. Typical application domains are insurance, e-commerce, streaming services, marketing and customer service solutions.

That is, data products are suitable for humans, through the facilitation of an end goal using data alone. In a corporate setting, data products need to â€œsolve a market problem" to directly generate revenue.  
They serve two main goals:
1)	Facilitate users with an advanced capability
2)	Provide businesses with a competitive advantage

Chat-bots, Language Translation and Face recognition are prime examples of popular data products.

# Student Learning Outcomes:
Participants are expected to have a mind-set of exploration and to study and learn beyond the class material itself (depending on their existing familiarity with the subject matter). This is not an academic course; we focus on skills.
You will learn design principles and best practices: design motifs that work well within Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Computer Vision (CV) domains of AI. Understanding basic neural network coding, modeling & implementation. Students will come to understand neural networks and their underlying architecture. That is, exploring the training and use of neural networks with visualization tools and data playgrounds such as playground.tensorflow.org.
The course explores Neural Network data products based upon the following themes:

-	Concepts: principles and foundations for the AI domains CV and NLP
- Algorithmics, Modeling & Data Science Basics
-	Python, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras.
-	Machine Learning & Deep Learning Basics
-	IPython/Jupyter Notebook Github repositories.
