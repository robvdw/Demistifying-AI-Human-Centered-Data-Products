Human centered data products are digital products that use Artificial Intelligence [AI] technology to visually support decision-making and help humans control complex systems. 
The data product landscape is dominated by data producers such as Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Tableau, Netflix. Typical application domains are insurance, e-commerce, streaming services, marketing and customer service solutions.

That is, data products are suitable for humans, through the facilitation of an end goal using data alone. In a corporate setting, data products need to “solve a market problem" to directly generate revenue.  
They serve two main goals:
1)	Facilitate users with an advanced capability
2)	Provide businesses with a competitive advantage

Chat-bots, Language Translation and Face recognition are prime examples of [popular data products](https://robfvdw.medium.com/a-generic-approach-to-data-driven-activities-d85ad558b5fa).



# Scope
A hands-on grounding of modern AI.

The course provides a roadmap for building conceptual prototypes of Human-Centered (HC) data-products by means of AI-platforms. 

AI platforms comprise software tools to build, deploy, and monitor machine learning algorithms. 
It involves the use of Data Science (DS) & Machine Learning (ML) models & algorithms to perform tasks that otherwise would be performed solely by humans. 

AI platforms aim to [mimic & automatise tasks which otherwise require human perception, cognition and/or motor skills](https://robfvdw.medium.com/the-world-wide-web-ai-safari-b2e4f7f90647):

* pattern recognition, 
* learning, logical reasoning & planning, 
* decision making, problem solving, 
* designing, 
* creativity, 
* likelihood estimation, 
* language acquisition,
* multi-sensory interfacing, 
* actuated body movement control
* locomotion & manipulation
* sentiment analysis
* generalisation



Thus, AI platforms combine automated human perception, cognition and/or motor skills with data, thereby enabling the creation of novel data products. 
Some platforms offer prebuilt ML algorithms and simplistic DS visualisation workflows with such features as drag-and-drop modeling and visual interfaces that easily connect necessary data to the end solution, while others require a greater knowledge of development and coding. 
Machine learning is a popular subset of data science that warrants specific attention when evaluating these platforms.

HC data products are digital products that use AI platforms to visually support decision-making and help humans control complex systems. 
Generally, a data product is the visually processed result, with the help of ML-algorithms, of complex data analysis of systems.
 
Data products aim to resolve "Wicked Problems":

* contain many interdependent influencing variables 
* do not have right or wrong solutions, only good and bad ones 
* can’t be solved with a formula and logic alone 
* can only be solved intuitively, not logically 
* are defined by social, psychological and cultural aspects.

The course covers handling of small-scale Neural Network (NN) datasets and aim to equip stundents with coding skills. 
Python will be the primary language of the course and while we do not expect you to have full proficiency in it.
We expect students at the end of the course to be able to read, (re)write & test Phyton code.
Lectures + coding examples will become availabe during the course itself.



# Student Learning Outcomes:
Participants are expected to have a mind-set of exploration and to study and learn beyond the class material itself (depending on their existing familiarity with the subject matter). 
This is not an academic course; we focus on skills.

You will aquire a basic insight into neural network modeling, through exploring the training and use of neural networks with visualization tools and data playgrounds such as the [tensorflow plaground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) or [Teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1/).

The course explores Neural Network data products based upon the following themes:

-	Concepts: principles and foundations for the AI domains CV and NLP
- Algorithmics, Modeling & Data Science Basics
-	Machine Learning & Deep Learning Basics
-	Tooling: IPython/Jupyter Notebook Github repositories.

# Use of Generative AI & Large Language Models
Use of Generative AI [Gen-AI] such as Co-Pilot, ChatGPT or BING is encouraged. It's important to make sure that other people are aware that these technologies were used. 

This can be done by including references or citations in the code or documentation, or by making a statement in the README file or other documentation that the project relies on these technologies. 

Additionally, it's also a good practice to include information about the limitations and potential biases of the technology in the documentation or code comments.
